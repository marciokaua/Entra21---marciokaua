    <p>Lorem Ipsum is simply dummy text of the printing and typesetting<br>industry. Lorem Ipsum has been the industry's standard dummy<br>text ever since the 1500s, when an unknown printer took a galley<br>of type and scrambled it to make a type specimen book. It has<br>survived not only five centuries, but also the leap into electronic<br>typesetting, remaining<span style="color:greenyellow;" > essentially </span> unchanged. It was popularised in<br>the 1960s with the release of Letraset sheets containing Lorem<br>Ipsum passages, and more recently with desktop publishing<br>software like Aldus PageMaker including versions of Lorem Ipsum.</p>
